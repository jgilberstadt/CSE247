Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question A1: Ticks = n^2 + 3*n, The time graph is quadratic.

Question A2: Every additional value causes the program to increase
linearly, meaning that the sum of the linear time increases
creates a quadratic graph.

Question B1: The running time curve is now linear because the while
loop only runs once instead of once per list value.

Question B2: This change did not require any additional storage.

Question B3: Adding a tail pointer to a list significantly decreases
the time it takes for the program to function when the while loop
runs multiple times. The tail pointer is not worthwhile when the while
loop only runs once. 

Question C1: getSize() uses n(n-1)/2 ticks because there are n
elements that are added with an average value of n-1/2.

Question C2: I started getSize() at the tail instead of the head so
